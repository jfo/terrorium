terrorium
=========

Working on a little terrarium with critters that totally eat each other and stuff. 


Life is an implementation of the classic game of life. Don't know why I can't get the neighbor comparisons to work without doing a Marshal dump of the world map contents first... seems like that should be easier to do. hmm.
